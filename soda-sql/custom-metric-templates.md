# Custom metric templates

A **metric** is a property of the data in your database. A **measurement** is the value for a metric that Soda checks against during a scan. You use metrics to define the tests that Soda executes against your data during a scan.

**Custom metrics**, also known as SQL metrics, enable you to define SQL queries that Soda executes against an entire dataset or against individual columns. Read more about using [custom metrics in Soda SQL]({% link soda-sql/sql_metrics.md %}#custom-metrics) and [custom metrics in Soda Cloud]({% link soda-cloud/monitors.md %}#metric-types).

The templates below offer examples of how you can define custom metrics to extract more complex measurements from your data.
